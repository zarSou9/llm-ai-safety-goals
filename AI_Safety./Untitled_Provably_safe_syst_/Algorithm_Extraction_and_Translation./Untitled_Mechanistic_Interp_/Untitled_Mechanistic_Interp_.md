	"abstract": "Understanding AI systems' inner workings is critical for ensuring value alignment and safety. This review explores mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the computational mechanisms and representations learned by neural networks into human-understandable algorithms and concepts to provide a granular, causal understanding. We establish foundational concepts such as features encoding knowledge within neural activations and hypotheses about their representation and computation. We survey methodologies for causally dissecting model behaviors and assess the relevance of mechanistic interpretability to AI safety. We examine benefits in understanding, control, alignment, and risks such as capability gains and dual-use concerns. We investigate challenges surrounding scalability, automation, and comprehensive interpretation. We advocate for clarifying concepts, setting standards, and scaling techniques to handle complex models and behaviors and expand to domains such as vision and reinforcement learning. Mechanistic interpretability could help prevent catastrophic outcomes as AI systems become more powerful and inscrutable.",

### Explanation

This paper reviews methods for reverse engineering neural networks to understand their internal mechanisms and representations, which directly supports the goal of extracting transparent algorithms from black-box AI systems. The focus on mechanistic interpretability techniques and their scalability challenges is highly relevant to developing reliable methods for converting opaque AI systems into verifiable implementations while preserving their capabilities.
