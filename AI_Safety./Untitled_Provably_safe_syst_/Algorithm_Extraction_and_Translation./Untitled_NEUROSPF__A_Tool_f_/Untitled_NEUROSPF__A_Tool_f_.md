	"abstract": "This paper presents NEUROSPF, a tool for the symbolic analysis of neural networks. Given a trained neural network model, the tool extracts the architecture and model parameters and translates them into a Java representation that is amenable for analysis using the Symbolic PathFinder symbolic execution tool. Notably, NEUROSPF encodes specialized peer classes for parsing the model's parameters, thereby enabling efficient analysis. With NEUROSPF the user has the flexibility to specify either the inputs or the network internal parameters as symbolic, promoting the application of program analysis and testing approaches from software engineering to the field of machine learning. For instance, NEUROSPF can be used for coverage-based testing and test generation, finding adversarial examples and also constraint-based repair of neural networks, thus improving the reliability of neural networks and of the applications that use them.

### Explanation

This paper presents NEUROSPF, a tool that translates trained neural networks into analyzable Java code and enables symbolic analysis of the network's behavior through techniques like coverage testing and constraint-based repair. This work is relevant to algorithm extraction as it provides a concrete method for converting neural networks into more transparent and verifiable code representations, though it may not fully preserve the original capabilities.
