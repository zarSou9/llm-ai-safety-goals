### Description

Identify and extract the fundamental discrete representations (e.g., bits, integers) that the neural network has learned to use internally. This includes detecting hidden state patterns and mapping them to interpretable discrete structures while preserving their relationships.

### Questions

- How can we leverage the geometric properties of activation space clusters to automatically identify the optimal basis vectors for discretizing neural network representations?

- What role do attention patterns and bottleneck architectures play in naturally encouraging neural networks to form discrete internal representations during training, and how can we exploit this understanding?

- How can we develop robust metrics to quantify the 'discreteness' of learned representations at different layers and use these metrics to guide automated extraction processes?

- What are the fundamental trade-offs between representation precision and interpretability when mapping continuous neural activations to discrete structures, and how can we optimize this mapping while maintaining functional equivalence?

- How do different training objectives and regularization schemes affect the emergence of discrete representations, and can we design novel training approaches specifically to encourage more interpretable discrete structures?

- What mathematical properties of neural network weight matrices indicate the presence of learned discrete operations, and how can we automatically detect these signatures?

- How can we leverage techniques from algebraic topology to identify and characterize the discrete manifolds that emerge in neural network hidden states?

- What role do adversarial examples and robustness play in verifying that extracted discrete representations truly capture the essential computational structure rather than surface-level patterns?
