	"abstract": "We present MIPS, a novel method for program synthesis based on automated mechanistic interpretability of neural networks trained to perform the desired task, auto-distilling the learned algorithm into Python code. We test MIPS on a benchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it highly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are not solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to convert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer symbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large language models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is therefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from GitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to make machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy.",

### Explanation

The paper demonstrates that neural networks naturally learn to use discrete representations internally, even when implemented with continuous mathematics. This suggests a systematic approach that progressively transforms continuous neural representations into discrete structures while preserving their computational meaning.

The breakdown follows the paper's key insight that this discovery requires three main transformations: first detecting potential discrete patterns in the network's continuous representations, then mapping these patterns to formal discrete structures, and finally validating that these structures capture the network's computational behavior. This progression ensures we maintain the network's core functionality while moving from continuous to discrete representations.

The sub-goals work together as a pipeline where each stage enables the next. Pattern detection reveals structures that can be mapped to discrete representations, which then allow us to validate and formalize their computational relationships. This matches how the paper's algorithm progressively transforms neural representations into increasingly structured forms while maintaining their essential properties.
