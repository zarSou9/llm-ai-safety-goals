### Description

Convert the neural network's operations into explicit lookup tables or transition functions based on the discovered discrete representations. This involves mapping how the network transforms its internal states and generates outputs in terms of the identified discrete structures.

### Questions

- How can we systematically identify and handle cases where neural networks implement equivalent logical operations through different continuous mathematical implementations, to ensure we extract the true underlying function rather than superficial patterns?

- What are effective methods for determining the minimal granularity of discrete state transitions needed to fully capture a neural network's behavior without introducing artifacts from over-discretization?

- How can we reliably distinguish between genuinely learned discrete transition functions versus continuous approximations that only appear discrete at certain scales or in certain regions of the activation space?

- What techniques can be developed to extract hierarchical transition functions when neural networks learn to compose multiple discrete operations, rather than just mapping simple input-output relationships?

- How can we validate that extracted transition functions maintain the same edge cases and corner-case behaviors as the original neural network, particularly for rare but important state combinations?

- What methods can detect and properly handle cases where neural networks learn to implement probabilistic transition functions rather than deterministic ones, while preserving the stochastic properties in the extracted functions?

- How can we efficiently identify and extract transition functions when the neural network uses distributed representations where single discrete states are encoded across multiple neurons or activation patterns?

- What approaches can verify that extracted transition functions maintain temporal dependencies and sequential processing patterns present in recurrent neural networks over multiple timesteps?
