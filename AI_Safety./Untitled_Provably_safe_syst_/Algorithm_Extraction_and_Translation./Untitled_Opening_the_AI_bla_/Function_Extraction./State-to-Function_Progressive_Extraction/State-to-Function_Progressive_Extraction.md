	"abstract": "We present MIPS, a novel method for program synthesis based on automated mechanistic interpretability of neural networks trained to perform the desired task, auto-distilling the learned algorithm into Python code. We test MIPS on a benchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it highly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are not solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to convert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer symbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large language models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is therefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from GitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to make machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy.",

### Explanation

The paper's MIPS method demonstrates that function extraction from neural networks follows a natural progression from understanding state representations to deriving symbolic functions. The key insight is that we must first understand how the network represents information before we can meaningfully extract its operations.

This breakdown follows that progression, starting with mapping the network's state space to interpretable representations, then capturing how these states transition, and finally deriving symbolic functions that encode these operations. Each step builds on the previous one, with the final goal being to produce explicit, verifiable functions that preserve the network's computational behavior.
