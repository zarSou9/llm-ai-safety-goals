### Description

Transform trained neural networks into their simplest equivalent form by exploiting symmetries and removing unnecessary complexity. This includes normalizing activations, simplifying weight matrices, and quantizing parameters to prepare the network for interpretation while preserving its functional behavior.

### Questions

- How can we systematically identify and exploit symmetries in weight matrices that arise from the training process to reduce network complexity without affecting behavior?

- What are the mathematical relationships between different quantization schemes and their impact on preserving specific types of neural computations (e.g., addition, multiplication, comparison operations)?

- How can we leverage knowledge of the task domain to inform network simplification - for example, if we know the network is performing sorting, can we identify and preserve just the comparison-relevant components?

- What topological properties of activation landscapes indicate redundant or unnecessary complexity that can be safely removed without impacting network function?

- How can we develop adaptive pruning criteria that consider both the local importance of parameters and their role in maintaining global network symmetries?

- What mathematical frameworks can help us identify when seemingly different network architectures are actually isomorphic implementations of the same computation?

- How can we detect and leverage cases where complex non-linear activation patterns can be approximated by simpler piecewise linear functions while maintaining functional equivalence?

- What theoretical bounds exist on the minimal number of parameters needed to implement specific algorithmic operations, and how can we use these to guide simplification?
