### Description

Synthesize a complete, executable program that implements the discovered algorithm while maintaining verifiability. This includes converting symbolic formulas into proper code syntax and structuring the program to preserve the original system's sequential processing behavior.

### Questions

- How can we automatically determine the most appropriate programming paradigm (functional, imperative, object-oriented) for the generated code based on the patterns found in the extracted symbolic formulas?

- What techniques can be developed to preserve and translate the temporal dependencies and sequential ordering constraints from symbolic formulas into proper program control flow structures while maintaining verifiability?

- How can we systematically identify and generate appropriate data structures and type definitions that optimally represent the intermediate computational states implied by the symbolic formulas?

- What methods can be developed to automatically generate program invariants and assertions from the symbolic formulas that help verify the correctness of the synthesized code?

- How can we determine the minimal set of helper functions and utility code needed to support the main algorithm implementation while maintaining readability and verifiability?

- What techniques can be developed to automatically refactor generated code to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency while preserving provable equivalence to the original symbolic formulas?

- How can we systematically translate mathematical operations in symbolic formulas into numerically stable implementations that handle edge cases and maintain precision requirements?
