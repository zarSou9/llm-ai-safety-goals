	"abstract": "We present MIPS, a novel method for program synthesis based on automated mechanistic interpretability of neural networks trained to perform the desired task, auto-distilling the learned algorithm into Python code. We test MIPS on a benchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it highly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are not solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to convert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer symbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large language models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is therefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from GitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to make machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy.",

### Explanation

The paper's MIPS method demonstrates that generating verifiable programs from symbolic formulas requires a series of progressive transformations, each building upon the previous to move from abstract mathematical representations toward concrete, executable code. The process begins with converting symbolic formulas into proper programming constructs, then structures these into a coherent program, and finally adds verification mechanisms.

This breakdown follows the natural progression from mathematical/logical expressions to verified code, with each sub-goal representing a distinct transformation phase. The sub-goals are ordered such that each builds upon the previous, starting with basic code expression generation, then program structure, and finally verification integration. This matches how the paper's method progressively refines representations into increasingly concrete and verifiable forms while maintaining computational equivalence.
