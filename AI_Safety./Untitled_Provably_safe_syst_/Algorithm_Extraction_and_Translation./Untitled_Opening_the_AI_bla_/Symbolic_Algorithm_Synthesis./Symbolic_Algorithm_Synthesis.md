### Description

Derive minimal symbolic formulas that capture the exact behavior of the extracted functions. This includes applying symbolic regression techniques to discover the simplest mathematical or logical expressions that reproduce the network's computation.

### Questions

- How can we leverage invariant representations and symmetries in neural networks to simplify the search space for symbolic regression while maintaining functional equivalence?

- What are effective methods for identifying and handling composite operations that should be expressed as a single symbolic formula rather than decomposed into simpler primitives?

- How can we incorporate domain-specific knowledge and constraints into symbolic regression to bias the search toward formulas that are more likely to generalize beyond the observed input-output pairs?

- What metrics beyond just accuracy and formula complexity should we use to evaluate candidate symbolic formulas to ensure they capture the true algorithmic essence rather than just fitting the data?

- How can we detect and handle cases where the neural network has learned to approximate a discrete algorithm using continuous mathematics in a way that makes direct symbolic regression unstable?

- What techniques can we develop to efficiently determine the appropriate level of mathematical abstraction (boolean, arithmetic, etc.) for expressing different components of the extracted algorithm?

- How can we leverage information about the training process and architecture of the original neural network to guide and constrain symbolic formula discovery?

- What methods can we develop to verify that discovered symbolic formulas maintain important invariants and edge case behaviors present in the original neural network?
