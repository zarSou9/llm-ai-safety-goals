We test MIPS on a benchmark of 62 algorithmic tasks that can be learned by an RNN and find it highly complementary to GPT-4: MIPS solves 32 of them, including 13 that are not solved by GPT-4 (which also solves 30). MIPS uses an integer autoencoder to convert the RNN into a finite state machine, then applies Boolean or integer symbolic regression to capture the learned algorithm. As opposed to large language models, this program synthesis technique makes no use of (and is therefore not limited by) human training data such as algorithms and code from GitHub. We discuss opportunities and challenges for scaling up this approach to make machine-learned models more interpretable and trustworthy.",

### Explanation

The paper presents a systematic approach to converting black-box neural networks into verifiable code through what it calls the MIPS (Mechanistic-Interpretability-based Program Synthesis) method. The core insight is that neural networks trained on algorithmic tasks tend to learn discrete internal representations and operations, even though they're implemented in continuous mathematics. By carefully extracting these discrete structures and the operations performed on them, we can reconstruct the underlying algorithm in a verifiable form.

The breakdown follows the paper's key insight that this conversion requires progressively transforming the neural network from continuous to discrete representations while preserving its computational behavior. Each sub-goal represents a crucial transformation step: first simplifying the network to reveal its core structure, then identifying the discrete representations it uses, extracting the operations it performs on these representations, discovering symbolic formulas for these operations, and finally generating proper code. This progression moves from continuous neural networks toward discrete, verifiable programs while maintaining functional equivalence at each step.

The sub-goals work together as a pipeline where each stage makes the next possible. Network simplification reveals patterns that enable discrete representation discovery, which in turn allows function extraction in terms of these representations. These extracted functions can then be converted to symbolic formulas, which provide the building blocks for generating the final program. This decomposition matches how the paper's MIPS algorithm progressively transforms neural networks into increasingly structured and discrete forms until reaching verifiable code, while each step maintains the system's core computational capabilities.
