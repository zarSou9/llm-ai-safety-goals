	"abstract": "A recent line of work in mechanistic interpretability has focused on reverse-engineering the computation performed by neural networks trained on the binary operation of finite groups. We investigate the internals of one-hidden-layer neural networks trained on this task, revealing previously unidentified structure and producing a more complete description of such models that unifies the explanations of previous works. Notably, these models approximate equivariance in each input argument. We verify that our explanation applies to a large fraction of networks trained on this task by translating it into a compact proof of model performance, a quantitative evaluation of model understanding. In particular, our explanation yields a guarantee of model accuracy that runs in 30% the time of brute force and gives a>=95% accuracy bound for 45% of the models we trained. We were unable to obtain nontrivial non-vacuous accuracy bounds using only explanations from previous works.",

### Explanation

This paper demonstrates progress in understanding and formally verifying how neural networks learn to perform group operations by extracting and proving properties about their internal mechanisms, which directly relates to the goal of converting black-box neural networks into transparent, verifiable implementations while preserving their capabilities.
