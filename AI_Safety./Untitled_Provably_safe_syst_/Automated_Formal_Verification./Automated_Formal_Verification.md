### Description

Develop the capability to automatically verify that complex software systems provably satisfy formal specifications. This includes both generating and checking mathematical proofs of compliance at the scale and complexity needed for AGI systems.

### Questions

- How can we develop compositional verification approaches that allow formally verified components to be safely combined into larger systems while preserving their security properties, without requiring reverification of the entire system?

- What mathematical frameworks could enable automated translation between high-level safety/alignment specifications written in natural language and formal specifications that can be mechanically verified?

- How can we create verification techniques that can handle learned components that continuously update during deployment, while still maintaining formal guarantees about system behavior?

- What methods could allow formal verification of the interface between perception systems and decision-making components in AI systems, without requiring full verification of the perception system itself?

- How can we develop incremental verification approaches that allow partial formal guarantees to be established and built upon during the iterative development of AI systems, rather than requiring complete specifications upfront?

- What techniques could enable formal verification of AI systems' robustness to distribution shift and out-of-distribution inputs while remaining computationally tractable?

- How can we create verification frameworks that can handle probabilistic and uncertainty-aware specifications while still providing meaningful safety guarantees for AI systems?

- What approaches could allow formal verification of the temporal stability of AI systems' learned behaviors and decision-making processes over extended periods of operation?
