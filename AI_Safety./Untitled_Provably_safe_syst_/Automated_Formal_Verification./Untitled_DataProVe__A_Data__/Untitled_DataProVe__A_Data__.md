	"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a tool, called DataProVe, for specifying high-level data protection policies and system architectures, as well as verifying the conformance between them in a fully automated way. The syntax of the policies and the architectures is based on semi-formal languages, and the automated verification engine relies on logic and resolution based proofs. The functionality and operation of the tool are presented using different examples.",

### Explanation

This paper presents DataProVe, a tool that automatically verifies whether system architectures comply with specified data protection policies through logic-based proofs. While this demonstrates progress in automated formal verification of specific security properties, it appears limited in scope compared to the comprehensive verification needs for AGI systems outlined in the sub-goal.
