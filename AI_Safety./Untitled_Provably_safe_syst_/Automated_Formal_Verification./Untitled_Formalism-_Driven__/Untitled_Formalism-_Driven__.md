	"abstract": "Decentralized systems have been widely developed and applied to address security and privacy issues in centralized systems, especially since the advancement of distributed ledger technology. However, it is challenging to ensure their correct functioning with respect to their designs and minimize the technical risk before the delivery. Although formal methods have made significant progress over the past decades, a feasible solution based on formal methods from a development process perspective has not been well developed. In this paper, we formulate an iterative and incremental development process, named formalism-driven development (FDD), for developing provably correct decentralized systems under the guidance of formal methods. We also present a framework named Seniz, to practicalize FDD with a new modeling language and scaffolds. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of FDD in practice with the support of Seniz.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes a formalism-driven development process and supporting framework called Seniz that enables developers to build provably correct decentralized systems through formal verification methods, which is relevant to the automated formal verification sub-goal as it presents a practical approach for integrating formal verification into complex system development.
