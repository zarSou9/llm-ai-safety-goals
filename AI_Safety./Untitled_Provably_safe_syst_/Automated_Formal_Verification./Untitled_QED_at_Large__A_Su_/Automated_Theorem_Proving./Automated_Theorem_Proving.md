### Description

Develop automated systems capable of discovering mathematical proofs at scale, particularly for verifying program properties. This includes both complete automation for simpler properties and semi-automated interactive proving for complex properties.

### Questions

- How can we leverage large language models' natural language understanding capabilities to automatically translate informal mathematical proofs from research papers into formal, machine-verifiable proof sketches?

- What neural architectures and training approaches would be most effective for learning to generate proof search guidance heuristics from large datasets of successful mathematical proofs?

- How can we develop hybrid systems that effectively combine symbolic reasoning with neural components while maintaining formal verification guarantees about the overall system's correctness?

- What techniques could enable automated theorem provers to effectively decompose complex proofs into smaller, more manageable sub-proofs while preserving logical soundness and completeness?

- How can we design proof search algorithms that explicitly reason about and exploit mathematical symmetries and invariants to reduce the search space?

- What methods could enable automated theorem provers to learn from failed proof attempts to improve their proving strategies over time while maintaining soundness?

- How can we develop automated methods for translating between different formal proof systems while preserving proof structure and insights, enabling better proof reuse and transfer learning?

- What approaches could enable automated theorem provers to effectively reason about continuous and infinite domains while maintaining formal rigor and computational tractability?
