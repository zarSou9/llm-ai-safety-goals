### Description

Create efficient and trustworthy systems for verifying the correctness of generated proofs. This includes developing small, verifiable proof checker kernels and efficient proof representations that can scale to complex AGI systems.

### Questions

- How can proof checker kernels be designed to maintain both formal verifiability and high performance when scaled to handle proofs with billions of steps that may arise in AGI system verification?

- What are the fundamental theoretical limits on proof compression techniques that preserve independent verifiability, and how close are current approaches to these limits?

- How can proof checking systems be architected to efficiently handle dynamic, streaming proofs that are generated and verified incrementally during AGI system operation?

- What novel proof representation formats could enable parallel verification while maintaining a minimal trusted computing base and formal guarantees of soundness?

- How can proof checking systems be designed to efficiently handle probabilistic and approximate reasoning while maintaining rigorous correctness guarantees for the overall verification?

- What techniques could enable proof checkers to efficiently verify proofs that involve complex numerical computations and floating-point arithmetic without expanding the trusted computing base?

- How can proof checking systems be designed to gracefully handle and recover from hardware errors while maintaining trustworthy verification, especially for long-running proofs?

- What novel approaches could enable proof checkers to efficiently verify proofs that involve reasoning about continuous time and hybrid systems while maintaining decidability?
