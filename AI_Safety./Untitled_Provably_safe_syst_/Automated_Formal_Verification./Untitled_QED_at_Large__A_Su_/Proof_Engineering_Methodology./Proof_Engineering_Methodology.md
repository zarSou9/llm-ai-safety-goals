### Description

Develop principles, patterns and tools for managing large-scale formal verification projects. This includes approaches for proof organization, reuse, and evolution that can scale to the complexity of AGI systems while remaining maintainable.

### Questions

- How can we develop automated metrics and analysis tools to evaluate the maintainability and evolvability of large formal proof developments, similar to code quality metrics in traditional software engineering?

- What patterns and abstractions can be created for managing proof dependencies and versioning when underlying specifications or implementations change, while minimizing the need to rebuild existing proofs?

- How can we effectively capture and formalize domain-specific proof strategies that emerge during verification projects to enable systematic reuse across similar proofs and knowledge transfer between teams?

- What visualization and navigation techniques could help engineers understand complex proof structures and their relationships at different levels of abstraction, particularly for proofs that span multiple components or properties?

- How can we design proof organization frameworks that gracefully handle uncertainty and partial verification, allowing teams to make incremental progress while maintaining clarity about what has and hasn't been fully proven?

- What methodologies can be developed for decomposing complex AGI system properties into more manageable proof obligations while ensuring that the decomposition itself preserves the desired safety guarantees?

- How can we create effective interfaces between different proof assistants and verification tools that preserve proof structure and reusability rather than just translating the final theorems?

- What techniques can be developed for automatically identifying and extracting common proof patterns from existing verification projects to build reusable proof libraries specifically targeted at AGI systems?
