Tools supporting such development have been available for over 40 years, but have only recently seen wide practical use. Projects based on construction of machine-checked formal proofs are now reaching an unprecedented scale, comparable to large software projects, which leads to new challenges in proof development and maintenance. Despite its increasing importance, the field of proof engineering is seldom considered in its own right; related theories, techniques, and tools span many fields and venues. This survey of the literature presents a holistic understanding of proof engineering for program correctness, covering impact in practice, foundations, proof automation, proof organization, and practical proof development.",

### Explanation

The paper demonstrates that effective proof engineering methodology requires addressing both theoretical foundations and practical implementation concerns. This naturally suggests organizing our approach around three complementary pillars: principles, infrastructure, and processes. The principles provide the theoretical foundation for how proofs should be structured and organized. The infrastructure provides the practical tools and frameworks needed to implement these principles at scale. The processes tie everything together by defining how to effectively apply the principles and infrastructure in practice.

This breakdown is informed by the paper's extensive coverage of design principles (Section 6.2), proof organization (Section 6.1), and practical development (Chapter 7). It recognizes that successful proof engineering requires not just knowing what makes a good proof, but having the tools and processes to consistently produce good proofs at scale.
