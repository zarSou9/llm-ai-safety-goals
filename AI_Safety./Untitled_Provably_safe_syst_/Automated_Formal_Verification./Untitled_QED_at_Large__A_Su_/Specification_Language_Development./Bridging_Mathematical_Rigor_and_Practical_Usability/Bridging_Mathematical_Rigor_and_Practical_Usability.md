Tools supporting such development have been available for over 40 years, but have only recently seen wide practical use. Projects based on construction of machine-checked formal proofs are now reaching an unprecedented scale, comparable to large software projects, which leads to new challenges in proof development and maintenance. Despite its increasing importance, the field of proof engineering is seldom considered in its own right; related theories, techniques, and tools span many fields and venues. This survey of the literature presents a holistic understanding of proof engineering for program correctness, covering impact in practice, foundations, proof automation, proof organization, and practical proof development.",

### Explanation

The development of specification languages requires carefully balancing mathematical precision with practical engineering needs. The paper demonstrates this through its discussion of various specification approaches, from mathematical foundations to practical tools like Ott and Lem. This suggests breaking down the challenge into three fundamental aspects: the mathematical foundations that ensure specifications are precise and verifiable, the practical expression mechanisms that make specifications usable for engineers, and the integration capabilities that connect specifications to verification tools.

    This breakdown ensures that resulting specification languages will be both mathematically rigorous and practically useful in real-world verification projects. It addresses both the theoretical foundations needed for sound verification and the practical considerations needed for adoption and scalability.
