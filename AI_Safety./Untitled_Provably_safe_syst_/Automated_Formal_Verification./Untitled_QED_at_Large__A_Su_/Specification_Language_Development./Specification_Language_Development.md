### Description

Design formal languages and frameworks for precisely expressing desired system properties and safety constraints. These must be both mathematically rigorous and practical for specifying complex behavioral and safety properties of AGI systems.

### Questions

- How can specification languages effectively capture and formalize emergent behaviors in complex AI systems that may not be apparent at the component level?

- What mathematical frameworks could enable compositional specification of safety properties such that local component-level specifications provably guarantee global system-level properties?

- How can specification languages be designed to express dynamic constraints that evolve based on an AI system's learning and adaptation while maintaining mathematical rigor?

- What formal approaches could allow specification languages to handle uncertainty and probabilistic behaviors while remaining tractable for automated verification?

- How can specification languages bridge the semantic gap between high-level human values/intentions and low-level mathematical properties in a way that preserves human meaning?

- What language constructs would enable formal specification of an AI system's information flow and knowledge acquisition constraints without overly restricting legitimate learning?

- How can specification languages formally express and verify properties about an AI system's internal optimization processes and objective functions?

- What formal frameworks could allow specifications to reason about the preservation of human control and oversight capabilities as an AI system becomes more capable?
