We describe the initial version of VERIFAI which centers on simulation guided by formal models and specifications. Several use cases are illustrated with examples, including temporal-logic falsification, model-based systematic fuzz testing, parameter synthesis, counterexample analysis, and data set augmentation.",

### Explanation

This paper presents VERIFAI, a software toolkit that enables formal verification and testing of AI/ML systems through simulation-guided analysis and specification checking, which directly supports the sub-goal of automated formal verification by providing practical tools for verifying AI system compliance with specifications, though it focuses more on finding violations than proving complete correctness.
