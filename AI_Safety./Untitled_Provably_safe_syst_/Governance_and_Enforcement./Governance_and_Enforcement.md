### Description

Implement a global system of policies, standards, and enforcement mechanisms that ensures only provably safe AI systems can be deployed. This includes coordinating international cooperation and creating incentive structures that make compliance universal.

### Questions

- How can we design and validate technical mechanisms for compute providers to accurately measure and report the total compute used by an AI system across distributed training runs while preserving commercial confidentiality?

- What are the optimal thresholds and transition periods for a tiered compute cap system that maintains AI progress in beneficial domains while preventing dangerous capability jumps, based on historical training data and capability scaling laws?

- How can we develop reliable technical methods to verify that a deployed AI model is functionally identical to its registered and approved version, accounting for potential obfuscation attempts?

- What organizational structures and incentive mechanisms would enable effective coordination between national AI regulatory bodies while preventing regulatory capture or race-to-the-bottom dynamics?

- How can we design empirically-validated evaluation protocols that reliably detect potentially dangerous capabilities in AI systems before they are fully trained or deployed at scale?

- What technical and organizational safeguards would enable secure sharing of safety-critical findings about AI systems between companies and regulators without risking capability proliferation?

- How can we create robust mechanisms for detecting and attributing attempts to circumvent AI governance systems through techniques like model splitting or distributed training across jurisdictions?
