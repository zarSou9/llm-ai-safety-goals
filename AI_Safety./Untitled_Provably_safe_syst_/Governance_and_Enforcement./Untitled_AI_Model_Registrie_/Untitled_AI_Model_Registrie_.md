	"abstract": "In this report, we propose the implementation of national registries for frontier AI models as a foundational tool for AI governance. We explore the rationale, design, and implementation of such registries, drawing on comparisons with registries in analogous industries to make recommendations for a registry that is efficient, unintrusive, and which will bring AI governance closer to parity with the governmental insight into other high-impact industries. We explore key information that should be collected, including model architecture, model size, compute and data used during training, and we survey the viability and utility of evaluations developed specifically for AI. Our proposal is designed to provide governmental insight and enhance AI safety while fostering innovation and minimizing the regulatory burden on developers. By providing a framework that respects intellectual property concerns and safeguards sensitive information, this registry approach supports responsible AI development without impeding progress. We propose that timely and accurate registration should be encouraged primarily through injunctive action, by requiring third parties to use only registered models, and secondarily through direct financial penalties for non-compliance. By providing a comprehensive framework for AI model registries, we aim to support policymakers in developing foundational governance structures to monitor and mitigate risks associated with advanced AI systems.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes implementing national registries for advanced AI models as a governance mechanism, requiring developers to register key information about their models while balancing oversight with innovation - directly addressing the sub-goal's focus on creating enforceable policies and standards for AI safety compliance. The registry approach provides a concrete framework for tracking and regulating AI development while creating incentive structures for compliance through both requirements on third-party use and financial penalties.
