	"abstract": "Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper presents adaptive governance as requiring both 'exploitation' (ensuring current effectiveness) and 'exploration' (gathering information and evolving). This naturally suggests a framework that separates the continuous gathering and analysis of information from the mechanisms that act on that information, whether through immediate response or systematic evolution of the governance framework itself.

The breakdown reflects this by establishing three complementary systems: Intelligence Systems gather and analyze information about governance effectiveness and emerging risks, Response Mechanisms enable quick action when needed, and Governance Evolution ensures systematic improvement over time. This creates a complete feedback loop where information gathering leads to both immediate action when necessary and systematic improvement over time, while maintaining clear separation of concerns between these functions.
