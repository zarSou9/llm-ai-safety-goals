	"abstract": "Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper presents enforcement as a multi-level challenge requiring both technical and institutional mechanisms working in concert. Analysis suggests that effective enforcement can be broken down into three core functional requirements: the ability to detect violations, the capacity to evaluate compliance, and the capability to take enforcement actions.

This framework separates enforcement into distinct phases that build on each other while maintaining clear boundaries of responsibility. Detection systems provide the raw data and evidence, evaluation processes determine if violations have occurred and their severity, and enforcement operations convert these determinations into appropriate actions. This creates a clear chain of enforcement that can operate consistently across all governance levels while maintaining appropriate checks and balances between detection, judgment, and action.
