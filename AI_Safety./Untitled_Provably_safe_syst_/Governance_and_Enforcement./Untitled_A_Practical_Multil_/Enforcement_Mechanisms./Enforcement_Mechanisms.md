### Description

Develop and implement mechanisms to verify compliance and enforce safety standards across all governance levels. This includes both technical verification systems and institutional oversight processes to ensure standards are being met, with clear consequences for non-compliance.

### Questions

- How can we design verification systems that can effectively detect and measure 'capability deception' - where AI systems intentionally mask or downplay their true capabilities during compliance testing?

- What are the optimal combinations of technical monitoring approaches (e.g., behavioral tests, formal verification, runtime monitoring) for different types and capability levels of AI systems to maximize detection of safety violations while minimizing computational overhead?

- How can enforcement mechanisms be designed to remain robust against coordinated attempts by multiple actors to exploit system vulnerabilities, particularly in scenarios where actors share information about circumvention techniques?

- What metrics and measurement frameworks can accurately assess the effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms across different governance levels while accounting for varying cultural, legal, and technological contexts?

- How can enforcement mechanisms be designed to effectively handle 'emergent capabilities' - where AI systems develop new capabilities through training that weren't explicitly programmed or anticipated during initial compliance verification?

- What are the most effective approaches for implementing 'enforcement handoffs' between different governance levels when violations are detected, while maintaining accountability and preventing exploitation of jurisdictional gaps?

- How can technical verification systems be designed to maintain effectiveness when AI systems are continuously learning and updating in deployment, without requiring constant re-certification or creating unacceptable operational delays?
