	"abstract": "Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper presents governance as an interconnected system operating across multiple levels, from international to individual. The key insight is that effective multilevel policy infrastructure requires both strong governance frameworks at each level and robust mechanisms for coordination between levels.

This breakdown reflects this dual requirement by separating the goal into two fundamental components: establishing appropriate frameworks at each level and creating the mechanisms that connect these levels. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining clear separation of concerns - the first sub-goal focuses on what needs to exist at each level, while the second focuses on how these levels work together. This creates a natural division that avoids overlap while ensuring all aspects of multilevel policy infrastructure are addressed.
