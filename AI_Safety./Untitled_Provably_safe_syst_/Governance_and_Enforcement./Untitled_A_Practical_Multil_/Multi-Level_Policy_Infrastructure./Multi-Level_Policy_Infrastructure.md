### Description

Establish coordinated governance frameworks across international, national, and industry levels that define requirements and standards for AI system safety. This includes creating formal mechanisms for policy coordination between levels and ensuring comprehensive coverage of all relevant aspects of AI system development and deployment.

### Questions

- How can policy frameworks effectively account for and regulate AI systems with emergent capabilities that weren't anticipated when the original standards were established?

- What mechanisms can enable rapid coordination and standard-setting between different governance levels when addressing novel AI safety challenges, while maintaining democratic legitimacy and avoiding regulatory capture?

- How can international AI safety standards be designed to accommodate meaningful variation in national regulatory approaches while still maintaining minimum effective safety requirements?

- What metrics and measurement frameworks can reliably assess the degree of policy alignment and coordination effectiveness between different governance levels in AI safety regulation?

- How can governance frameworks be structured to effectively regulate AI systems developed through decentralized collaboration across multiple jurisdictions?

- What institutional design patterns best enable consistent interpretation and application of AI safety standards across different cultural and legal contexts while maintaining local relevance?

- How can policy frameworks effectively distinguish between and separately regulate different components of AI systems when they are developed by different entities across multiple jurisdictions?

- What mechanisms can enable rapid propagation of updated safety standards across governance levels while ensuring proper validation and maintaining policy coherence?
