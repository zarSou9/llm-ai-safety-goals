	"abstract": "Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper presents participatory governance as a multilevel system requiring both structural elements and dynamic mechanisms to enable meaningful stakeholder participation. Analysis suggests three fundamental requirements: 1) physical infrastructure to enable participation, 2) well-designed processes to make participation meaningful, and 3) mechanisms to make participation sustainable.

This breakdown organizes the components identified in the paper's framework into these three strategic categories. The Participation Infrastructure provides the basic channels and representation mechanisms needed for participation to occur. The Input Integration Processes ensure that participation actually influences decisions in a structured way. Finally, the Sustainability Mechanisms create the feedback loops and incentives needed to maintain meaningful participation over time. Together, these three elements create a complete and self-sustaining participatory governance system.
