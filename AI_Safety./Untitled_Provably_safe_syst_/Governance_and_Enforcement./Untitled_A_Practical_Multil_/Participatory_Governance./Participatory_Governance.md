### Description

Create systems and processes that enable meaningful participation from all stakeholder groups in the development and refinement of governance frameworks. This includes establishing formal channels for bottom-up input and ensuring representation from technical, business, and civil society perspectives.

### Questions

- How can digital democracy tools be designed to enable meaningful participation from stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise while maintaining the rigor needed for AI governance decisions?

- What are the optimal mechanisms for weighting and aggregating input from different stakeholder groups when their expertise, risk exposure, and interests conflict in AI governance decisions?

- How can we measure and optimize the 'epistemic value add' of different stakeholder participation methods to ensure participatory processes actually improve governance outcomes rather than just providing procedural legitimacy?

- What organizational structures and processes best enable productive collaboration between technical AI safety researchers and civil society representatives who may lack deep technical knowledge but offer crucial perspective on societal impacts?

- How can participatory governance systems be designed to maintain both speed and quality of decision-making as the number and diversity of stakeholders increases?

- What mechanisms can ensure meaningful representation from marginalized communities and Global South perspectives in AI governance while preventing capture by well-resourced interest groups?

- How can stakeholder participation systems be designed to effectively surface early warning signals about emerging AI risks while filtering out noise and false alarms?

- What are the optimal feedback loop structures between technical AI development teams and broader stakeholder groups that maximize the likelihood of incorporating stakeholder input into technical design decisions?
