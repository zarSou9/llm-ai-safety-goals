	"abstract": "Autonomous and intelligent systems (AIS) facilitate a wide range of beneficial applications across a variety of different domains. However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper's multilevel governance framework reveals that effective incentive alignment requires coordinated mechanisms across different scales of organization - from individual to international. This suggests that rather than focusing on specific types of incentives (economic, social, etc.), we should focus on creating comprehensive systems that make safety the natural choice at every level.

The breakdown identifies three fundamental pillars needed for universal incentive alignment: Economic Alignment ensures that safety is the financially optimal choice through both rewards and penalties, Market Structure Development creates self-reinforcing market dynamics that favor safety, and Cultural/Professional Evolution establishes lasting norms and values that internalize safety priorities. These pillars work together - economic alignment provides immediate motivation, market structures create sustained pressure, and cultural evolution ensures long-term stability of safety-conscious behavior.
