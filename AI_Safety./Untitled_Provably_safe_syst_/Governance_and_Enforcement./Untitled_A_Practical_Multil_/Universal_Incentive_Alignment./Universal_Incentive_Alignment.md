### Description

Design and implement incentive structures that make compliance with safety standards the most attractive option for all stakeholders. This includes both positive incentives for compliance and mechanisms to make non-compliance economically and operationally unfavorable.

### Questions

- How can game theory be applied to design incentive structures that remain stable even when some actors have significantly more resources or technological capabilities than others in the AI development landscape?

- What are the psychological and organizational factors that cause safety compliance incentives to break down during periods of intense competition or perceived existential threat to an organization, and how can incentive structures be designed to remain robust under such conditions?

- How can incentive mechanisms be designed to effectively handle the unique challenges of AI development, where the potential downsides of non-compliance may not be immediately visible or measurable until it's too late?

- What novel approaches could leverage prediction markets or other crowd-based mechanisms to create early warning systems that incentivize proactive safety compliance rather than reactive enforcement?

- How can incentive structures be designed to properly account for and reward positive externalities from safety research sharing while protecting legitimate competitive advantages?

- What mechanisms could create credible commitment devices that allow AI development organizations to voluntarily bind themselves to safety standards in ways that are difficult to reverse, even under future pressure?

- How can incentive structures be designed to remain effective when dealing with potentially superhuman AI systems that might find novel ways to game or circumvent traditional reward mechanisms?
