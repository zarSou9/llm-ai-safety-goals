However, technical characteristics such as unpredictability and lack of transparency, as well as potential unintended consequences, pose considerable challenges to the current governance infrastructure. Furthermore, the speed of development and deployment of applications outpaces the ability of existing governance institutions to put in place effective ethical-legal oversight. New approaches for agile, distributed and multilevel governance are needed. This work presents a practical framework for multilevel governance of AIS. The framework enables mapping actors onto six levels of decision-making including the international, national and organizational levels. Furthermore, it offers the ability to identify and evolve existing tools or create new tools for guiding the behavior of actors within the levels. Governance mechanisms enable actors to shape and enforce regulations and other tools, which when complemented with good practices contribute to effective and comprehensive governance.",

### Explanation

The paper presents a comprehensive multilevel governance framework that approaches AI safety governance as an interconnected system operating across six levels: international, national, domain, organizational, team, and individual. The core insight is that effective governance requires coordination and alignment across all these levels, with both top-down enforcement and bottom-up participation mechanisms working in concert.

The breakdown reflects this multilevel approach while organizing it around key functional requirements for achieving the goal. Multi-Level Policy Infrastructure provides the basic framework and rules, while Enforcement Mechanisms and Universal Incentive Alignment ensure these rules are followed. Participatory Governance ensures the system remains legitimate and informed by all stakeholders, while Adaptive Oversight ensures it remains effective as technology evolves. This structure separates distinct functional needs while maintaining the paper's emphasis on their interconnection.

These sub-goals work together as an integrated system: the policy infrastructure defines what must be done, enforcement mechanisms ensure it is done, incentive structures make stakeholders want to do it, participatory governance keeps it grounded in reality, and adaptive oversight keeps it current and effective. This reflects the paper's emphasis on both formal structures (policies, enforcement) and dynamic elements (participation, adaptation) as essential to effective governance. Each sub-goal addresses a distinct and necessary function while supporting the others, creating a comprehensive approach to ensuring only provably safe AI systems are deployed.
