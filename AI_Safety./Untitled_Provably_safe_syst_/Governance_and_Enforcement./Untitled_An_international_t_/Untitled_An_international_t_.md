	"abstract": "This paper presents an international treaty to reduce risks from the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The main provision of the treaty is a global compute cap: a ban on the development of AI systems above an agreed-upon computational resource threshold. The treaty also proposes the development and testing of emergency response plans, negotiations to establish an international agency to enforce the treaty, the establishment of new communication channels and whistleblower protections, and a commitment to avoid an AI arms race. We hope this treaty serves as a useful template for global leaders as they implement governance regimes to protect civilization from the dangers of advanced artificial intelligence.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes an international treaty centered on implementing a global cap on computational resources used for AI development, along with supporting governance mechanisms like emergency response plans and enforcement agencies, which directly addresses the sub-goal of creating global policies and enforcement mechanisms to ensure AI safety. The proposal's focus on international cooperation and universal compliance through treaty obligations makes it highly relevant to establishing coordinated governance structures for AI development.
