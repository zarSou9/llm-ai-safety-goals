### Description

Implement mechanisms to guarantee clean hardware states before and after use, preventing information leakage between different executions. This includes verifiable reset capabilities and state verification systems that can be cryptographically proven.

### Questions

- How can we develop provable bounds on the maximum amount of state information that could persist in various types of hardware components (e.g. capacitors, transistors, memory cells) after standard reset procedures?

- What novel verification techniques could be developed to detect subtle forms of hardware state persistence that might be exploitable by an adversarial AI system, such as electron trapped states or thermal memory effects?

- How can we design hardware components that maintain verifiable state isolation properties even under extreme environmental conditions (temperature, radiation, EM fields) that might be weaponized by an adversarial system?

- What cryptographic protocols could enable remote verification of complete hardware state resets without requiring trust in the verification hardware itself?

- How can we develop formal models to reason about and prove the completeness of hardware state clearing across complex interconnected components with potential emergent state properties?

- What novel physical mechanisms beyond traditional electronic reset signals could provide stronger guarantees of complete state clearing (e.g. optical, quantum, or phase change approaches)?

- How can we design hardware that maintains provable state isolation properties even when components are operating at their physical limits in terms of clock speed, voltage, or temperature?

- What techniques could detect and prevent subtle forms of cross-state contamination through physical side channels like power consumption patterns or electromagnetic emissions between supposedly isolated hardware states?
