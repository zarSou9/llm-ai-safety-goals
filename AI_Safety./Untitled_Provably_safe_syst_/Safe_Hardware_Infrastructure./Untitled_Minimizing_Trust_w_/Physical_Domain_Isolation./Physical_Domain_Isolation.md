### Description

Establish complete hardware-level isolation between different computational domains, ensuring no shared hardware components or communication channels exist except through explicitly defined interfaces. This includes separate processors, memory, and I/O devices for different security domains.

### Questions

- How can we design hardware-level isolation mechanisms that maintain their security properties even when components degrade or fail over time, without creating new potential information leakage channels through the degradation process itself?

- What are the fundamental physical limits on how closely we can pack physically isolated computational domains while still maintaining provable isolation against electromagnetic interference, heat dissipation, and quantum effects?

- How can we develop testing methodologies to verify physical domain isolation that don't themselves introduce new attack surfaces or require compromising the isolation to perform the verification?

- What novel materials or physical structures could enable dynamic reconfiguration of hardware isolation boundaries without introducing shared components or creating temporary bridges between domains during the reconfiguration process?

- How can we design physically isolated domains that are resistant to side-channel attacks exploiting previously unknown physical phenomena, rather than just protecting against known attack vectors?

- What architectural patterns could enable hierarchical physical isolation where domains can be nested within domains while maintaining complete isolation guarantees at each level?

- How can we implement physical domain isolation in quantum computing hardware where entanglement and measurement could potentially create implicit information channels between otherwise isolated components?
