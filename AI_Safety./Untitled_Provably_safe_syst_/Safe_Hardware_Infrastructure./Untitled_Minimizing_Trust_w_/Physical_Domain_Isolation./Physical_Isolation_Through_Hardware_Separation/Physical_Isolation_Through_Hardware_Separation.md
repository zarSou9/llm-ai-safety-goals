	"abstract": "Smartphone owners often need to run security-critical programs on the same device as other untrusted and potentially malicious programs. This requires users to trust hardware and system software to correctly sandbox malicious programs, trust that is often misplaced. Our goal is to minimize the number and complexity of hardware and software components that a smartphone owner needs to trust to withstand adversarial inputs. We present a multi-domain hardware design composed of statically-partitioned, physically-isolated trust domains. We introduce a few simple, formally-verified hardware components to enable a program to gain provably exclusive and simultaneous access to both computation and I/O on a temporary basis. To manage this hardware, we present OctopOS, an OS composed of mutually distrustful subsystems. We present a prototype of this machine (hardware and OS) on a CPU-FPGA board and show that it incurs a small hardware cost compared to modern SoCs. For security-critical programs, we show that this machine significantly reduces the required trust compared to mainstream TEEs while achieving decent performance. For normal programs, performance is similar to a legacy machine.",

### Explanation

The paper demonstrates that achieving true physical domain isolation requires more than just separate hardware components - it requires a comprehensive approach that establishes, maintains, and verifies the isolation. The strategy focuses on three fundamental aspects: the physical separation itself, the mechanisms to maintain that separation over time, and the ability to verify the isolation is working as intended.

This breakdown is informed by the paper's implementation which showed that while physical separation forms the foundation, careful attention must be paid to maintaining isolation through proper domain management and verification mechanisms. The sub-goals work together in a hierarchical fashion - physical separation provides the foundation, isolation maintenance ensures it remains effective during operation, and isolation verification provides ongoing assurance of security.
