### Description

Develop hardware-enforced mechanisms for controlling access to critical resources and ensuring exclusive use when needed. This includes systems for delegating control, enforcing quotas, and maintaining security properties during resource transitions.

### Questions

- How can hardware-level resource quotas be designed to gracefully handle scenarios where an AI system attempts to exploit timing-based race conditions or deliberately exhaust its quota to create denial-of-service conditions?

- What are the fundamental tradeoffs between granularity of resource control and verification complexity when implementing hardware-enforced access controls, and how can we optimize this balance for AI systems with varying levels of capability?

- How can we design resource delegation mechanisms that maintain provable security properties even when the delegating entity becomes compromised or attempts to exploit the delegation chain after the fact?

- What novel hardware primitives could enable dynamic resource reallocation between security domains while maintaining perfect isolation guarantees and preventing covert channels during the transition process?

- How can we implement hardware-level resource accounting that remains accurate and tamper-proof even against adversaries with the ability to manipulate clock signals or exploit analog properties of the underlying circuits?

- What mechanisms could enable secure resource borrowing between domains while guaranteeing that borrowed resources can be forcibly reclaimed, even if the borrowing domain becomes uncooperative or adversarial?

- How can resource access control mechanisms be designed to maintain security properties even when dealing with quantum computing resources that may have inherently probabilistic or entangled states?
