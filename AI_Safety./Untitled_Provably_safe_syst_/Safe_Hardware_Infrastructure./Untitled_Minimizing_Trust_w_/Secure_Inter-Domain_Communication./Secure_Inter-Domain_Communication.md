### Description

Create verifiable and tamper-proof communication channels between isolated hardware domains. These channels must enforce exclusive access, prevent unauthorized interference, and maintain security properties even when connecting trusted and untrusted domains.

### Questions

- How can we design communication protocols that maintain provable security properties even when one domain deliberately attempts to exploit timing variations in the channel to leak information?

- What are the fundamental physical limits on creating truly unidirectional communication channels between hardware domains, and how can we approach these limits in practical implementations?

- How can we leverage recent advances in post-quantum cryptography to design inter-domain communication protocols that remain secure against adversaries with quantum computing capabilities while maintaining strict performance requirements?

- What novel verification techniques could enable formal proof of information-flow properties across domain boundaries when the domains operate at different privilege levels and trust assumptions?

- How can we design communication channels that maintain security properties even when one domain attempts to exploit electromagnetic interference or other physical side-channels to influence another domain's behavior?

- What are effective methods for dynamically reconfiguring inter-domain communication paths while maintaining continuous proof of security properties and preventing temporary vulnerabilities during transitions?

- How can we create communication protocols that remain secure even when an adversarial domain has precise control over the timing and sequencing of messages to attempt to create race conditions or other temporal vulnerabilities?
