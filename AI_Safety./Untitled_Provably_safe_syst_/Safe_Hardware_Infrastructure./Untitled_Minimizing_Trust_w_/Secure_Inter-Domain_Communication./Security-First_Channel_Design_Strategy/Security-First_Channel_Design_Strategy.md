	"abstract": "Smartphone owners often need to run security-critical programs on the same device as other untrusted and potentially malicious programs. This requires users to trust hardware and system software to correctly sandbox malicious programs, trust that is often misplaced. Our goal is to minimize the number and complexity of hardware and software components that a smartphone owner needs to trust to withstand adversarial inputs. We present a multi-domain hardware design composed of statically-partitioned, physically-isolated trust domains. We introduce a few simple, formally-verified hardware components to enable a program to gain provably exclusive and simultaneous access to both computation and I/O on a temporary basis. To manage this hardware, we present OctopOS, an OS composed of mutually distrustful subsystems. We present a prototype of this machine (hardware and OS) on a CPU-FPGA board and show that it incurs a small hardware cost compared to modern SoCs. For security-critical programs, we show that this machine significantly reduces the required trust compared to mainstream TEEs while achieving decent performance. For normal programs, performance is similar to a legacy machine.",

### Explanation

The paper demonstrates that secure inter-domain communication requires both physical isolation and verifiable exclusive access as foundational principles. Building on this insight, the strategy focuses first on establishing fundamentally secure channels through physical design and protocols, then implementing precise access control to maintain security during actual use.

Critically, given the high stakes of AI safety, we separate verification into its own goal rather than treating it as just an implementation detail. This ensures that formal verification and security validation receive focused attention throughout the development process. This three-part approach - secure channels, controlled access, and rigorous verification - provides a complete framework for achieving provably secure communication between isolated domains.
