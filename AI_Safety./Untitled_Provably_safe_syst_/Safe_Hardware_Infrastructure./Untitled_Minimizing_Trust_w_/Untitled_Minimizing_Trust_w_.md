This requires users to trust hardware and system software to correctly sandbox malicious programs, trust that is often misplaced. Our goal is to minimize the number and complexity of hardware and software components that a smartphone owner needs to trust to withstand adversarial inputs. We present a multi-domain hardware design composed of statically-partitioned, physically-isolated trust domains. We introduce a few simple, formally-verified hardware components to enable a program to gain provably exclusive and simultaneous access to both computation and I/O on a temporary basis. To manage this hardware, we present OctopOS, an OS composed of mutually distrustful subsystems. We present a prototype of this machine (hardware and OS) on a CPU-FPGA board and show that it incurs a small hardware cost compared to modern SoCs. For security-critical programs, we show that this machine significantly reduces the required trust compared to mainstream TEEs while achieving decent performance. For normal programs, performance is similar to a legacy machine.",

### Explanation

The paper presents a novel approach to hardware security based on the principle of "provably exclusive access" and physical isolation. Rather than trying to create secure sharing of hardware resources, it advocates for complete physical separation with carefully controlled interactions. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional hardware security approaches that rely on privilege levels and dynamic isolation.

The breakdown follows the paper's key architectural components but reorganizes them around the fundamental security properties needed for AI safety. Physical Domain Isolation serves as the foundation, creating separate "trust domains" that minimize attack surfaces. Secure Inter-Domain Communication and Hardware State Management work together to allow these isolated domains to interact safely while preventing information leakage. Resource Access Control provides the mechanisms needed to coordinate resource use across domains while maintaining security properties. Finally, Verified Core Components represents the minimal "trusted computing base" that must be formally verified to guarantee the system's security properties.

These sub-goals form an interlocking system where each reinforces the others. Physical isolation prevents side-channel attacks and hardware-level vulnerabilities, but requires secure communication channels to be useful. These channels in turn depend on proper state management to prevent information leakage between uses. Resource access control builds on these primitives to enable practical coordination between domains. The verified core components provide the foundation of trust that allows the other mechanisms to be proven secure. Together, they create a hardware infrastructure that can provably enforce security constraints even against superintelligent adversaries by making certain behaviors physically impossible rather than just programmatically restricted.
