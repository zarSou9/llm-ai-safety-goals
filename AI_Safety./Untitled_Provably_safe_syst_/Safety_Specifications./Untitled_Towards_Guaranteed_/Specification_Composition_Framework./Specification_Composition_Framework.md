### Description

Develop a framework for composing complex safety specifications from simpler, verified components. This includes methods for combining multiple specifications, handling conflicts between specifications, and ensuring that composition preserves safety properties while maintaining tractability.

### Questions

- How can we develop formal metrics to quantify the degree of interference or synergy between composed safety specifications, enabling us to identify and optimize beneficial compositional patterns?

- What mathematical properties must a specification composition operator preserve to guarantee that safety properties proven for individual components remain valid in the composed system, while avoiding exponential complexity growth?

- How can we create reversible specification composition mechanisms that allow for graceful decomposition when conflicts are detected, without losing the verified properties of the original components?

- What formal frameworks could enable dynamic specification composition at runtime while maintaining provable safety bounds, particularly for systems that need to adapt their safety constraints based on context?

- How can we develop composition methods that explicitly handle temporal dependencies between specifications, ensuring that safety properties remain valid across different timescales and sequential interactions?

- What mathematical structures could enable hierarchical specification composition while preserving verifiability at each level of abstraction, similar to how programming languages support modular reasoning?

- How can we formally characterize and minimize the 'compositional overhead' - the additional complexity and computational cost introduced by combining specifications compared to verifying them individually?

- What techniques could enable the automatic detection and resolution of specification composition conflicts while preserving the original safety intentions of each component specification?
