### Description

Develop methods to learn and refine safety specifications from data, human feedback, and formal analysis. This includes techniques for extracting implicit specifications from examples, validating learned specifications against human intent, and updating specifications based on new information while maintaining safety guarantees.

### Questions

- How can we develop formal metrics to quantify the degree of alignment between learned specifications and human intent, particularly for complex safety properties that may be difficult for humans to explicitly articulate?

- What mathematical frameworks could enable the continuous refinement of safety specifications while providing formal guarantees that updates cannot introduce new failure modes or violate previously established safety properties?

- How can we detect and mitigate specification learning failures that arise from distributional shift in training data, especially when the shift occurs in subtle aspects of human values or safety requirements?

- What techniques could enable the extraction of implicit safety specifications from demonstrations while being robust against human inconsistency and mistakes, without overfitting to specific demonstration artifacts?

- How can we develop active learning approaches that efficiently identify and resolve ambiguities in learned specifications while minimizing the required human feedback and avoiding leading questions?

- What methods could enable the automated detection of potential specification gaming behaviors during the learning process, before they manifest in deployed systems?

- How can we formally represent and learn specifications that capture not just constraints on behavior, but also the underlying reasons and principles behind those constraints in a way that generalizes to novel situations?

- What approaches could enable specification learning systems to identify and resolve conflicts between different sources of specification information (e.g., demonstrations, feedback, formal rules) while maintaining coherence and safety?
