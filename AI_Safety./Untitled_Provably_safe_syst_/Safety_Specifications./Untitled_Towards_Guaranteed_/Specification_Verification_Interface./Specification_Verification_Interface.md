### Description

Create interfaces between safety specifications and verification systems that enable efficient proof generation and checking. This includes developing specification languages that balance expressiveness with tractability and methods for decomposing specifications into verifiable components.

### Questions

- How can we develop intermediate representation languages that serve as bridges between high-level safety specifications and low-level verification systems while preserving semantic meaning and facilitating automated proof generation?

- What are effective methods for automatically detecting and quantifying the verification complexity of different specification components to enable strategic decomposition that optimizes for proof tractability?

- How can we design specification interfaces that support incremental verification, allowing parts of a specification to be verified independently while maintaining compositional guarantees about the whole system?

- What techniques can we develop for automatically translating between different formal specification languages while preserving verifiability properties and maintaining proof compatibility across different verification tools?

- How can we create adaptive interfaces that automatically adjust the granularity and structure of specifications based on the capabilities and limitations of different verification approaches?

- What methods can we develop for automatically generating verification lemmas and intermediate proof steps from high-level specifications to bridge the gap between specification and verification?

- How can we design specification interfaces that explicitly track and manage assumptions about the verification system's capabilities, ensuring specifications remain verifiable as verification tools evolve?

- What approaches can we develop for automatically detecting and resolving conflicts between specification expressiveness and verification tractability through targeted specification refinement?
