	"abstract": "Ensuring that AI systems reliably and robustly avoid harmful or dangerous behaviours is a crucial challenge, especially for AI systems with a high degree of autonomy and general intelligence, or systems used in safety-critical contexts. In this paper, we will introduce and define a family of approaches to AI safety, which we will refer to as guaranteed safe (GS) AI. The core feature of these approaches is that they aim to produce AI systems which are equipped with high-assurance quantitative safety guarantees. This is achieved by the interplay of three core components: a world model (which provides a mathematical description of how the AI system affects the outside world), a safety specification (which is a mathematical description of what effects are acceptable), and a verifier (which provides an auditable proof certificate that the AI satisfies the safety specification relative to the world model). We outline a number of approaches for creating each of these three core components, describe the main technical challenges, and suggest a number of potential solutions to them. We also argue for the necessity of this approach to AI safety, and for the inadequacy of the main alternative approaches.",

### Explanation

The paper suggests that effectively incorporating uncertainty into safety specifications requires handling both Bayesian (probabilistic) and Knightian (unknown unknowns) uncertainty, as well as uncertainty about the specifications themselves. This points to a layered approach where we first develop comprehensive ways to represent these different forms of uncertainty, then create methods to properly integrate them into specifications, and finally ensure robustness under uncertainty.

This breakdown separates the core challenges into three distinct layers that build upon each other. The first layer establishes the formal foundations for representing all forms of uncertainty. The second layer develops methods to properly incorporate these uncertainty representations into safety specifications. The third layer ensures that specifications remain robust and effective under uncertainty, including preventing specification gaming. This layered approach allows us to tackle each aspect of uncertainty integration while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
