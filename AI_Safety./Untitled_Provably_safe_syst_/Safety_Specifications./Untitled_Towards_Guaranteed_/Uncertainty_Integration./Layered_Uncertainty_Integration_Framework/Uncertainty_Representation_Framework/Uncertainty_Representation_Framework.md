Develop formal frameworks for representing both Bayesian and Knightian uncertainty, as well as uncertainty about specifications themselves. This includes creating mathematical foundations for expressing probabilistic uncertainty, unknown unknowns, and meta-uncertainty about specification correctness in a way that enables formal reasoning and verification.
