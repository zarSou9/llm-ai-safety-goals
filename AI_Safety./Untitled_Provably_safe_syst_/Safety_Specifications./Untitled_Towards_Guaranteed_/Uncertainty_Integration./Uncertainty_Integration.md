### Description

Create methods to formally incorporate both Bayesian and Knightian uncertainty into safety specifications. This includes developing ways to express uncertainty about the specification itself, handle edge cases and ambiguity, and ensure specifications remain robust under uncertainty while avoiding specification gaming.

### Questions

- How can we develop formal methods to quantify and propagate meta-uncertainty (uncertainty about our uncertainty estimates) through safety specifications while maintaining computational tractability?

- What mathematical frameworks could allow safety specifications to gracefully degrade under increasing uncertainty rather than failing catastrophically when uncertainty thresholds are exceeded?

- How can we formally represent and handle correlations between different sources of uncertainty in safety specifications, particularly when these correlations themselves are uncertain?

- What techniques could enable dynamic reallocation of uncertainty budgets across different components of a safety specification based on runtime feedback while maintaining global safety guarantees?

- How can we develop methods to formally distinguish between reducible and irreducible uncertainty in safety specifications, and optimize specification robustness differently for each type?

- What mathematical approaches could allow safety specifications to adaptively adjust their conservatism based on the estimated quality and reliability of uncertainty measurements?

- How can we create formal methods to detect and handle cases where uncertainty in one part of a specification could be exploited to game another part, while maintaining specification robustness?

- What techniques could enable safety specifications to formally reason about and handle uncertainty that emerges from the interaction between multiple specifications, rather than just uncertainty within individual specifications?
