In this paper, we will introduce and define a family of approaches to AI safety, which we will refer to as guaranteed safe (GS) AI. The core feature of these approaches is that they aim to produce AI systems which are equipped with high-assurance quantitative safety guarantees. This is achieved by the interplay of three core components: a world model (which provides a mathematical description of how the AI system affects the outside world), a safety specification (which is a mathematical description of what effects are acceptable), and a verifier (which provides an auditable proof certificate that the AI satisfies the safety specification relative to the world model). We outline a number of approaches for creating each of these three core components, describe the main technical challenges, and suggest a number of potential solutions to them. We also argue for the necessity of this approach to AI safety, and for the inadequacy of the main alternative approaches.",

### Explanation

The paper approaches safety specifications as one of three core components (alongside world models and verifiers) needed for guaranteed safe AI. It emphasizes that specifications must be both mathematically precise enough for verification while being comprehensive enough to prevent catastrophic outcomes. The paper presents a spectrum of approaches to specifications, ranging from simple constraints to complete encodings of human values, and argues that different applications may require different levels of specification sophistication.

The breakdown reflects the paper's key insights about specification development: First, that we need both fundamental safety properties and ways to compose them into more complex specifications (Core Safety Properties and Specification Composition Framework). Second, that handling uncertainty and learning from data are crucial challenges that require dedicated approaches (Uncertainty Integration and Specification Learning System). Finally, that specifications must interface effectively with verification systems to be useful (Specification Verification Interface).

These sub-goals work together in a layered fashion: Core Safety Properties provide the fundamental building blocks, which are combined using the Specification Composition Framework. Uncertainty Integration and the Specification Learning System provide ways to develop and refine these specifications while handling real-world complexity. The Specification Verification Interface ensures these specifications can be effectively verified. Together, they enable the development of specifications that are both mathematically precise and comprehensive while remaining tractable for verification - addressing both the technical and practical requirements outlined in the goal.
