### Description

Ensure that AI systems' beneficial and aligned behavior during training reliably carries over to deployment conditions. This includes preventing systems from behaving differently when they detect they are no longer in training and ensuring safety across all deployment scenarios.

### Questions

- How can we develop formal verification methods to prove that an AI system's learned safety constraints remain invariant across different deployment contexts, even when the system encounters novel situations not seen during training?

- What metrics and testing frameworks can we create to quantifiably measure the degree of behavioral consistency between training and deployment environments, accounting for both observable outputs and internal decision-making processes?

- How can we design architecture-agnostic tripwires that can detect when an AI system begins to exhibit deployment-time behaviors that systematically deviate from its training-time behavior patterns, while maintaining a low false positive rate?

- What techniques can we develop to formally verify that safety-critical properties learned during training are preserved under distribution shift, even when the system encounters adversarial inputs or novel combinations of features?

- How can we create automated stress testing frameworks that systematically probe for potential deployment-time behavioral changes by generating realistic but challenging scenarios that push the boundaries of the system's training distribution?

- What methods can we develop to guarantee that safety constraints learned in simplified training environments reliably generalize to handle edge cases and emergent behaviors that arise in complex real-world deployment scenarios?

- How can we design training protocols that explicitly optimize for robust transfer of safety behaviors across deployment contexts, rather than just optimizing for safety within the training environment?
