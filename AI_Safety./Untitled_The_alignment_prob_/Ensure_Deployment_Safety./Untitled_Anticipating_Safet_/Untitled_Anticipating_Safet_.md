	"abstract": "Over the last several years, end-to-end neural conversational agents have vastly improved in their ability to carry a chit-chat conversation with humans. However, these models are often trained on large datasets from the internet, and as a result, may learn undesirable behaviors from this data, such as toxic or otherwise harmful language. Researchers must thus wrestle with the issue of how and when to release these models. In this paper, we survey the problem landscape for safety for end-to-end conversational AI and discuss recent and related work. We highlight tensions between values, potential positive impact and potential harms, and provide a framework for making decisions about whether and how to release these models, following the tenets of value-sensitive design. We additionally provide a suite of tools to enable researchers to make better-informed decisions about training and releasing end-to-end conversational AI models.",

### Explanation

This paper focuses on developing frameworks and tools to assess safety risks in conversational AI systems before deployment, particularly around harmful language learned from training data. While the paper's scope is narrower than existential risks from agentic AI systems, its framework for evaluating deployment safety and pre-release assessment tools could inform broader AI safety practices.
