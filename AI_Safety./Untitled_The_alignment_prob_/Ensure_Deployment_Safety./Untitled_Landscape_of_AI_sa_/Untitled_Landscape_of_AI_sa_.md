	"abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key technology, driving advancements across a range of applications. Its integration into modern autonomous systems requires assuring safety. However, the challenge of assuring safety in systems that incorporate AI components is substantial. The lack of concrete specifications, and also the complexity of both the operational environment and the system itself, leads to various aspects of uncertain behavior and complicates the derivation of convincing evidence for system safety. Nonetheless, scholars proposed to thoroughly analyze and mitigate AI-specific insufficiencies, so-called AI safety concerns, which yields essential evidence supporting a convincing assurance case. In this paper, we build upon this idea and propose the so-called Landscape of AI Safety Concerns, a novel methodology designed to support the creation of safety assurance cases for AI-based systems by systematically demonstrating the absence of AI safety concerns. The methodology's application is illustrated through a case study involving a driverless regional train, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes a methodology called "Landscape of AI Safety Concerns" to systematically identify and address safety issues in AI systems, with a focus on creating safety assurance cases for autonomous systems like driverless trains. While the paper addresses AI safety, it appears to focus more on immediate operational safety rather than existential risks from agentic AI systems, making it only tangentially relevant to the specific sub-goal of preventing catastrophic loss of control.
