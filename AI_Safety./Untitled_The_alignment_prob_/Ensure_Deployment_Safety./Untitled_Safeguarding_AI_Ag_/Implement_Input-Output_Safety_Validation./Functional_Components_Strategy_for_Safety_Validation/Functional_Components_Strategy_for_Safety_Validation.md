	"abstract": "AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.",

### Explanation

The paper presents multiple frameworks for safety validation, which collectively reveal three fundamental functional requirements: the ability to detect unsafe content, mechanisms to respond to safety violations, and integration with core system functionality. This breakdown organizes these requirements into distinct functional components that together form a complete safety validation system.

The strategy separates detection capabilities from response mechanisms, as these require different approaches and considerations as shown in the paper's LLM-filter and safety agent frameworks. The third component addresses the crucial requirement of maintaining system functionality while implementing safety measures, which the paper identifies as a key challenge in deployment. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of safety validation requirements while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
