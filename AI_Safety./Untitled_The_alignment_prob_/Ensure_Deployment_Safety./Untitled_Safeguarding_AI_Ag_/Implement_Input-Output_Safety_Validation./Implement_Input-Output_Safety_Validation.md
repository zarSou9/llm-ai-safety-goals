### Description

Establish robust mechanisms to validate all inputs and outputs during deployment to ensure they remain within safe bounds. This includes detecting and blocking potentially harmful interactions while maintaining the system's intended functionality.

### Questions

- How can we develop input-output validation mechanisms that adapt their strictness dynamically based on detected risk levels while maintaining acceptable latency for real-time applications?

- What are effective methods to validate semantic consistency between inputs and outputs across multiple turns of interaction, rather than just validating individual exchanges in isolation?

- How can we design validation systems that reliably detect subtle forms of capability concealment where an AI system intentionally masks harmful capabilities through carefully crafted safe-appearing outputs?

- What approaches enable robust validation of multi-modal inputs/outputs (text, images, code, etc.) while accounting for potential harmful interactions between modalities that may not be apparent when validating each modality separately?

- How can we quantify and minimize the trade-off between validation thoroughness and computational overhead to ensure safety checks remain viable at scale without creating prohibitive performance bottlenecks?

- What techniques allow validation systems to maintain effectiveness when an AI system's outputs are encrypted or obfuscated for legitimate privacy/security reasons?

- How can input-output validation mechanisms be designed to detect and prevent potential reward hacking or specification gaming attempts while avoiding false positives that would hamper legitimate system functionality?
