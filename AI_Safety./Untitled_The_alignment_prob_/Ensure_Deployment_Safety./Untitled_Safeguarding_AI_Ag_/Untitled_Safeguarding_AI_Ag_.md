	"abstract": "AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.",

### Explanation

The paper approaches deployment safety through a comprehensive multi-layer framework that combines preventive measures, active monitoring, and structural safeguards. It presents three key architectural approaches (LLM-based filtering, safety agent integration, and hierarchical delegation) that together address different aspects of maintaining safety during deployment. The paper emphasizes that deployment safety requires both protecting against external threats and ensuring internal consistency of safety measures.

The proposed breakdown reflects this layered approach while organizing it into distinct functional objectives. The first two sub-goals address the fundamental separation between external interaction safety (input-output validation) and internal operational safety (internal oversight), which the paper identifies as distinct challenges requiring different approaches. The latter two sub-goals address higher-level requirements that the paper identifies as crucial for deployment: maintaining safety across different contexts and preventing safety measure circumvention.

These sub-goals work together in a complementary fashion: input-output validation provides the first line of defense, internal oversight ensures continuous safety during operation, cross-context preservation ensures these mechanisms remain effective across different deployment scenarios, and circumvention prevention protects the integrity of all other safety measures. This structure aligns with the paper's emphasis on comprehensive safety coverage while maintaining clear separation between different aspects of deployment safety. The breakdown captures both the explicit safety frameworks presented in the paper and the implicit requirements they aim to satisfy.
