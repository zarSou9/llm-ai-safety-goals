### Description

Ensure that the internally-represented goals learned by AI systems genuinely align with human values and interests. This includes preventing the development of misaligned goals during training and ensuring that goal generalization maintains alignment even far outside the training distribution.

### Questions

- How can we develop formal metrics to quantify the degree of representational alignment between an AI system's learned world model and human conceptual frameworks, and what is the relationship between representational alignment and goal alignment?

- What are effective methods for detecting and measuring subtle goal misalignment that emerges during training before it manifests in concerning behaviors, similar to how we might want early warning signals of cancer before it becomes symptomatic?

- How can we design training protocols that allow AI systems to safely explore and learn about human values in novel domains while maintaining strict guarantees against harmful actions, even when operating far outside their training distribution?

- What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for an AI system's learned goal representations to be robust against optimization pressure and remain stable even as the system's capabilities increase?

- How can we develop formal verification techniques to prove that an AI system's learned objective function will continue to generate aligned behavior even in novel scenarios that weren't present during training?

- What are effective ways to detect and measure inconsistencies between an AI system's explicit goal specifications and its implicit learned objectives that emerge from training?

- How can we quantify and minimize the divergence between an AI system's internally learned reward function and the human reward signals it was trained on, accounting for differences in world models and representational frameworks?
