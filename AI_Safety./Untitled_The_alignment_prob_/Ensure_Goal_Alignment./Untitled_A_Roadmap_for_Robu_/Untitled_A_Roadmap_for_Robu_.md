In other words, we have presented a large number of hopefully more tractable subproblems that readers are highly encouraged to tackle. Hopefully, this combination allows to better highlight the most pressing problems, how every expertise can be best used to, and how combining the solutions to subproblems might add up to solve robust alignment.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes a structured 5-step roadmap for solving the challenge of robustly aligning AI systems' goals with human preferences, breaking down this complex problem into more manageable subproblems that can be tackled individually. This directly addresses the AI safety sub-goal by providing a framework for ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values, thereby reducing risks of loss of control or catastrophic outcomes.
