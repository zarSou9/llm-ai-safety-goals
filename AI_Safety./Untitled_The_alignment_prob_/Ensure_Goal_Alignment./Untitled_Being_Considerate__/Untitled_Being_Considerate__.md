In this paper we study the notion of pluralistic alignment in the context of agentic AI, and in particular in the context of an agent that is trying to learn a policy in a manner that is mindful of the values and perspective of others in the environment. To this end, we show how being considerate of the future wellbeing and agency of other (human) agents can promote a form of pluralistic alignment.",

### Explanation

This paper explores how training AI systems to be considerate of human wellbeing and agency could help achieve pluralistic alignment - ensuring AI systems respect diverse human values and perspectives rather than optimizing for a single set of objectives. This approach is relevant to AI safety as it proposes a potential mechanism for preventing misaligned AI systems that might pursue goals harmful to humanity's diverse interests and values.
