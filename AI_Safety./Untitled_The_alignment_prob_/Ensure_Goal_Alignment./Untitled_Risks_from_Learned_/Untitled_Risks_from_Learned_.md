We believe that the possibility of mesa-optimization raises two important questions for the safety and transparency of advanced machine learning systems. First, under what circumstances will learned models be optimizers, including when they should not be? Second, when a learned model is an optimizer, what will its objective be - how will it differ from the loss function it was trained under - and how can it be aligned? In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of these two primary questions and provide an overview of topics for future research.",

### Explanation

This paper examines the risks of "mesa-optimization," where an AI system learns to be an optimizer itself during training, potentially developing objectives that differ from its training goals - a key concern for ensuring AI systems remain aligned with human values and don't pose existential risks through misaligned optimization behavior.
