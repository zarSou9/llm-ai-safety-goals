	"abstract": "One obstacle to applying reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world problems is the lack of suitable reward functions. Designing such reward functions is difficult in part because the user only has an implicit understanding of the task objective. This gives rise to the agent alignment problem: how do we create agents that behave in accordance with the user's intentions? We outline a high-level research direction to solve the agent alignment problem centered around reward modeling: learning a reward function from interaction with the user and optimizing the learned reward function with reinforcement learning. We discuss the key challenges we expect to face when scaling reward modeling to complex and general domains, concrete approaches to mitigate these challenges, and ways to establish trust in the resulting agents.",

### Explanation

This paper proposes reward modeling - learning reward functions through user interaction - as an approach to ensure AI systems behave according to human intentions, which directly addresses the challenge of maintaining human control over AI systems and preventing misaligned behavior that could lead to catastrophic outcomes. The approach focuses on learning accurate reward functions that capture human values and preferences, making it relevant to preventing the development of misaligned goals during training.
