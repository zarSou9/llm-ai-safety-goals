	"abstract": "As humans interact with autonomous agents to perform increasingly complicated, potentially risky tasks, it is important that humans can verify these agents' trustworthiness and efficiently evaluate their performance and correctness. In this paper we formalize the problem of value alignment verification: how to efficiently test whether the goals and behavior of another agent are aligned with a human's values? We explore several different value alignment verification settings and provide foundational theory regarding value alignment verification. We study alignment verification problems with an idealized human that has an explicit reward function as well as value alignment verification problems where the human has implicit values. Our theoretical and empirical results in both a discrete grid navigation domain and a continuous autonomous driving domain demonstrate that it is possible to synthesize highly efficient and accurate value alignment verification tests for certifying the alignment of autonomous agents.",

### Explanation

This paper develops methods for efficiently testing and verifying whether an AI system's goals and behaviors align with human values, which directly addresses the challenge of ensuring AI systems remain under meaningful human control and act in accordance with human interests. The work is relevant to AI safety by providing concrete approaches to detect misalignment before it can lead to harmful outcomes.
