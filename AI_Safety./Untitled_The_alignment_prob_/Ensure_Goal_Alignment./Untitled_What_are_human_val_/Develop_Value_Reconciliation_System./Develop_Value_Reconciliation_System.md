### Description

Create a system for reconciling different human values into a coherent alignment target that can guide AI behavior. This includes establishing methods to determine which values apply in which contexts and how to resolve apparent conflicts between values in a way that preserves wisdom and expertise.

### Questions

- How can we quantify and measure the 'wisdom content' of different value perspectives to help determine which should take precedence in reconciliation, without simply defaulting to majority opinion or traditional authority?

- What are effective techniques for detecting when seemingly conflicting values are actually addressing different levels of abstraction or different aspects of a situation, and how can we leverage this understanding in reconciliation?

- How can we identify and account for cases where the intersection or synthesis of multiple competing values might produce better outcomes than selecting any single value perspective to dominate?

- What methods can be developed to detect and correct for cases where reconciled values inadvertently create perverse incentives or unintended consequences when implemented together?

- How can we systematically identify which contextual factors should trigger different weightings or priorities in value reconciliation, beyond simple domain categorization?

- What techniques can be developed to preserve minority value perspectives that contain unique wisdom or expertise within a reconciliation framework while still producing coherent guidance?

- How can we measure and optimize for the internal consistency and logical coherence of a set of reconciled values while still maintaining their connection to human wisdom and expertise?
