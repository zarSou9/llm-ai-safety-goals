### Description

Ensure that elicited and reconciled values can effectively generalize to novel situations beyond the training distribution. This includes developing mechanisms to apply values appropriately in new contexts while maintaining their essential meaning and wisdom.

### Questions

- How can we quantify and measure the 'distance' between a novel situation and previously encountered scenarios to determine when and how much to trust value generalization?

- What are effective methods for identifying and preserving the essential invariant properties of human values that should remain constant during generalization, while allowing context-appropriate flexibility in their application?

- How can we develop formal frameworks to detect and prevent value drift or corruption during iterative generalization steps, particularly when values are applied to increasingly distant contexts?

- What role can counterfactual reasoning play in testing the robustness of value generalization, and how can we systematically generate relevant counterfactuals that stress-test generalization mechanisms?

- How can we identify and formalize the meta-principles humans use when generalizing their own values to novel situations, and how might these principles be encoded into AI systems?

- What are effective ways to decompose complex values into more fundamental components that might generalize more reliably, while preserving the emergent properties of the original values?

- How can we develop formal methods to detect when a novel situation requires fundamental value reconsideration versus simple value application, and what triggers should prompt such reassessment?

- What mathematical frameworks can best capture the uncertainty inherent in value generalization while maintaining actionable decision-making capabilities in novel contexts?
