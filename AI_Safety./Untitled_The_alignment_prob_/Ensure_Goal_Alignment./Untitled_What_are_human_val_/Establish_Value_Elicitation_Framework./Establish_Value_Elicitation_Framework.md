### Description

Create a robust framework for eliciting genuine human values that can serve as the foundation for AI goal alignment. This includes developing methods to extract and represent values in a way that captures what humans truly care about, while being resistant to manipulation and ideological influence.

### Questions

- How can we detect and measure when value elicitation processes are being influenced by social desirability bias versus reflecting genuine personal values, and what techniques can minimize this bias while maintaining authentic responses?

- What are the key differences in value expression and articulation between individuals who have deeply reflected on their values versus those who haven't, and how can we design elicitation methods that help surface more considered values regardless of prior reflection?

- How do different temporal frames (immediate vs long-term consequences) affect the values people express, and what methods can help elicit values that better account for both immediate and long-term considerations?

- To what extent can we identify and measure 'meta-values' (values about how values should be formed and updated) across different populations, and how might these meta-values inform better elicitation frameworks?

- How do different cognitive loads during value elicitation affect the consistency and depth of expressed values, and what is the optimal cognitive engagement level for authentic value articulation?

- What role do embodied experiences play in value formation and expression, and how can we design elicitation methods that account for the gap between abstract value statements and lived experiential values?

- How can we measure and account for the dynamic nature of value evolution within individuals over time while still creating stable representations for AI alignment purposes?

- What are the quantifiable differences in value expressions when people are asked about their own values versus when they're asked about what values they believe should guide AI systems, and how can we bridge this potential gap?
