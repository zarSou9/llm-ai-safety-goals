### Description

Ensure humans in control positions maintain intentions that align with responsible oversight and control objectives. This includes fostering appropriate motivations for control actions while preventing conflicts of interest or misaligned incentives that could compromise effective control.

### Questions

- How do different organizational structures and reporting hierarchies impact the alignment of control intentions among AI oversight personnel, and what structures best preserve aligned intentions even under pressure?

- What psychological mechanisms drive the erosion of control intentions over time when working closely with AI systems, and how can these degradation patterns be detected and mitigated early?

- How do different compensation and incentive structures for AI oversight roles affect the maintenance of aligned control intentions, and what novel incentive mechanisms could better align individual motivations with responsible control objectives?

- What role does professional identity and self-perception play in maintaining aligned control intentions among AI safety personnel, and how can positive professional identity be cultivated to reinforce appropriate oversight motivations?

- How do different approaches to communicating and reinforcing organizational values impact the stability of control intentions among oversight staff, and what novel communication frameworks could better maintain alignment?

- What early warning indicators can reliably predict potential misalignment of control intentions before they manifest in behavior, and how can these indicators be systematically monitored?

- How does repeated exposure to AI capabilities affect human controllers' perceived status relative to AI systems, and what interventions can maintain appropriate authority dynamics without breeding overconfidence or submission?

- What role does team composition and diversity play in maintaining aligned control intentions across an oversight group, and how can team dynamics be optimized to create robust alignment?
