### Description

Ensure humans have sufficient knowledge and understanding of AI systems to make informed control decisions. This includes understanding system capabilities, limitations, current state, potential risks, and the effects of possible interventions. The level of understanding must remain adequate even as systems become more complex.

### Questions

- How does the complexity and depth of ML model architectures correlate with human operators' ability to build accurate mental models of system behavior, and what are the key architectural features that most impact comprehensibility?

- What are effective methods for conveying uncertainty in AI system predictions/decisions to human operators in real-time, particularly for high-dimensional or abstract task domains where uncertainty visualization is non-trivial?

- How do different approaches to AI system interpretability (e.g. post-hoc explanations vs. inherently interpretable models) affect human operators' ability to predict and prevent failure modes before they occur?

- What cognitive biases and mental shortcuts do human operators develop when monitoring AI systems over extended periods, and how do these heuristics impact their ability to maintain accurate understanding of system capabilities?

- How can we quantitatively measure the gap between an AI system's actual capabilities/limitations and a human operator's mental model of those capabilities/limitations? What metrics would be most meaningful?

- What are effective strategies for maintaining human operator understanding as AI systems undergo continuous learning and evolution in deployment? How can we ensure mental models stay calibrated with changing system behavior?

- How does the fidelity and completeness of AI system logging/monitoring data affect human operators' ability to investigate and understand system behavior? What is the optimal balance between comprehensiveness and comprehensibility?

- What role does hands-on experience with AI system failure modes play in building operator understanding, and how can we safely simulate important failure scenarios for training purposes?
