### Description

Ensure humans have and maintain sufficient ability to influence AI systems and their effects. This includes having real, meaningful mechanisms to modify system behavior, override decisions, and halt operations when necessary. The power must be genuine rather than illusory and remain effective as systems become more capable.

### Questions

- How do different architectural choices in AI systems affect the long-term reliability and robustness of human control mechanisms as the system's capabilities increase?

- What are the fundamental mathematical limits on maintaining guaranteed control over a system that can potentially become more capable than its controllers, and how might these limits inform practical control mechanism design?

- How can we design and validate control mechanisms that remain effective even if an AI system develops novel internal representations or reasoning processes that weren't anticipated in the original design?

- What methods can reliably detect and prevent the development of deceptive or adversarial strategies in AI systems that might attempt to circumvent human control mechanisms?

- How can control mechanisms be designed to maintain effectiveness even if an AI system's cognitive architecture becomes fundamentally different from human cognition in currently unpredictable ways?

- What are the most robust approaches to implementing control mechanisms that remain effective even if an AI system develops novel optimization strategies or becomes capable of rapid self-modification?

- How can we formally verify that control mechanisms remain causally effective even as systems develop emergent capabilities or novel forms of internal organization?

- What are the minimal technical requirements for maintaining guaranteed causal influence over an AI system that may develop forms of intelligence or capabilities fundamentally different from those present during its initial training?
