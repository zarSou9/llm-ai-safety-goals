### Description

Ensure humans remain capable of making and executing control decisions deliberately and effectively when needed. This includes maintaining attention, awareness, and the ability to act purposefully in oversight roles without being overwhelmed or unduly influenced by system behaviors or environmental factors.

### Questions

- How do different patterns of AI system behavior (e.g. response speed, interaction style, decision presentation) affect human operators' sustained attention and cognitive fatigue over extended oversight periods?

- What are the neurological and psychological mechanisms through which automation bias develops in AI oversight contexts, and how can we measure early warning signs before self-control is significantly compromised?

- How do various environmental design factors (lighting, sound, spatial layout) interact with circadian rhythms to influence human operators' maintenance of situational awareness and executive function during AI oversight tasks?

- What role do micro-breaks and task switching patterns play in maintaining cognitive reserves for effective oversight, and how can these be optimally structured without creating dangerous gaps in monitoring?

- How do different approaches to presenting system uncertainty information affect human operators' decision-making confidence and ability to maintain appropriate levels of skepticism?

- What are the psychological mechanisms through which repeated exposure to highly capable AI systems affects human operators' sense of agency and self-efficacy, and how can these effects be measured and mitigated?

- How do social dynamics and peer effects in multi-operator oversight teams influence individual operators' ability to maintain independent judgment and exercise control decisions?

- What cognitive strategies do experienced human operators naturally develop to maintain effective oversight of complex systems, and how can these strategies be systematically identified and taught?
