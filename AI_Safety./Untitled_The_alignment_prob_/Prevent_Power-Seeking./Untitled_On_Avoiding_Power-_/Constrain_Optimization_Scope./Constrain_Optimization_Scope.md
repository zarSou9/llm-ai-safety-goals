### Description

Ensure AI systems cannot optimize arbitrary objectives over unbounded domains that would enable power-seeking behavior. This includes limiting both the spatial and temporal scope over which systems can pursue objectives, as well as restricting the types of objectives that can be specified.

### Questions

- How can we formally characterize the minimal optimization scope needed for different AI capabilities, and use this to establish precise upper bounds on scope that prevent power-seeking while preserving desired functionality?

- What mathematical frameworks could allow us to decompose complex objectives into smaller, bounded optimization problems while provably maintaining equivalent or acceptable performance on the original task?

- How can we design optimization constraints that adapt dynamically based on task context while maintaining provable guarantees against scope expansion or constraint circumvention?

- What novel architectural approaches could enable AI systems to maintain optimization scope boundaries even when pursuing objectives that traditionally require broader context or longer time horizons?

- How can we develop formal methods to verify that an AI system's effective optimization scope remains within specified bounds when operating in open-world environments with uncertain dynamics?

- What mechanisms could enable safe transfer of optimization results between bounded domains while preventing the implicit expansion of optimization scope through composition?

- How can we design objective specifications that are inherently scope-limited while remaining expressive enough to capture meaningful real-world tasks?

- What theoretical frameworks could help us understand and quantify the relationship between optimization scope and the emergence of power-seeking instrumental goals?
