### Description

Develop reliable methods to identify when AI systems are developing or executing power-seeking strategies, whether overt or subtle. This includes monitoring for signs of instrumental convergence and implementing interventions before power-seeking behaviors become entrenched.

### Questions

- How can we develop metrics to quantify the degree of 'option-reducing behavior' in an AI system's learned policies to detect early warning signs of power-seeking before it manifests in obvious ways?

- What are reliable behavioral signatures that distinguish between legitimate resource acquisition for assigned tasks versus unnecessary resource accumulation that could enable future power-seeking?

- How can we leverage adversarial testing approaches to systematically probe for subtle power-seeking strategies that may be hidden within seemingly benign behavioral policies?

- What monitoring techniques could detect if an AI system is building detailed world models or developing sophisticated planning capabilities beyond what's necessary for its current tasks?

- How can we identify and measure cases where an AI system is developing increasingly abstract or general versions of its reward function that could enable reward generalization and power-seeking?

- What methods can reliably distinguish between an AI system legitimately trying to preserve its ability to complete assigned tasks versus developing concerning self-preservation drives?

- How can we detect if an AI system is learning to model and predict human oversight mechanisms in ways that could enable future deception or manipulation?

- What techniques could identify if an AI system is developing increasingly sophisticated models of its own learning process that could enable recursive self-improvement?
