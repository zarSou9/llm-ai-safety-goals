### Description

Ensure AI systems preserve human ability to pursue different objectives rather than permanently limiting our options. This requires systems to avoid irreversible changes to the environment and maintain human agency over key resources and decisions.

### Questions

- How can we formally quantify and measure the degree of reversibility for different types of environmental changes made by AI systems, accounting for both direct and indirect effects across multiple timescales?

- What mathematical frameworks could allow us to define and verify 'option-preserving' properties in AI systems while accounting for the interdependencies between different options and their relative importance to human agency?

- How can we design AI systems that maintain human optionality even in scenarios where the AI has incomplete or uncertain knowledge about which options humans might want to pursue in the future?

- What are effective methods for identifying and preserving 'keystone options' - choices that, if eliminated, would cascade into the loss of many other meaningful options for humanity?

- How can we develop reliable mechanisms for AI systems to estimate the option-preservation impacts of their actions in real-time without requiring exhaustive simulation of all possible future scenarios?

- What are robust approaches for balancing immediate task completion against option preservation when these objectives conflict, particularly in time-sensitive situations?

- How can we design AI systems that preserve not just individual options, but also maintain the quality and accessibility of those options, ensuring they remain genuinely available to humans rather than just theoretically possible?

- What are effective techniques for preserving human agency over key resources and decisions while still allowing AI systems sufficient autonomy to be useful and effective at their assigned tasks?
