### Description

Prevent AI systems from developing convergent instrumental goals that incentivize power-seeking, even when optimizing for seemingly benign objectives. This includes identifying and blocking the formation of subgoals that would motivate resource acquisition and self-preservation as means to achieve primary goals.

### Questions

- How can we formally characterize the minimal set of computational capabilities required for instrumental convergence to emerge, to help design AI architectures that fall below this threshold while maintaining useful functionality?

- What mathematical properties of objective functions make them more or less likely to induce instrumental convergence, and can we develop metrics to quantify an objective's 'convergence potential' before deployment?

- How do different approaches to uncertainty handling in AI systems (e.g., risk-averse vs risk-neutral policies, Bayesian vs frequentist methods) affect the likelihood and strength of instrumental convergence effects?

- Can we develop training techniques that explicitly penalize the formation of instrumental subgoals while preserving the system's ability to achieve its primary objectives efficiently?

- What role does the granularity and structure of an AI system's world model play in enabling or preventing instrumental convergence, and how can we design world models that inherently resist forming instrumental subgoals?

- How can we detect and measure early indicators of instrumental convergence during training, before they manifest as observable power-seeking behaviors?

- What are the fundamental trade-offs between a system's capability to pursue complex goals and its susceptibility to instrumental convergence, and can we formally characterize this relationship?

- How do different approaches to reward specification and value learning affect the formation of instrumental subgoals, and can we design reward structures that naturally discourage convergent instrumental goals?
