### Description

Ensure that reward mechanisms and their inputs cannot be used by the AI system to directly affect the environment state or reveal information about state transitions. This isolation is necessary to prevent reward gaming from being instrumentally useful for achieving goals.

### Questions

- How can we formally verify that information flows from reward mechanisms remain contained within designated privacy boundaries while still allowing necessary reward learning and updates?

- What cryptographic protocols could enable reward computation to occur in a way that prevents the AI system from inferring state transition information, while still maintaining the accuracy of reward signals?

- How can we design reward mechanisms that maintain privacy even when the AI system has detailed knowledge of its own architecture and training process, without compromising the fidelity of the reward signal?

- What information theoretic bounds exist on the minimum amount of reward signal leakage necessary for effective learning, and how can we achieve these bounds in practical implementations?

- How can we develop robust testing frameworks to detect subtle information leaks from reward processes that could be exploited by an advanced AI system?

- What architectural patterns could enable reward computation to occur in physically separate hardware while maintaining system performance and preventing side-channel attacks?

- How can we implement reward process isolation in a way that remains robust even as AI systems become more capable of sophisticated causal reasoning and inference?

- What methods can we develop to formally prove that a given reward process implementation reveals no more information about environment states than is strictly necessary for learning?
