### Description

Ensure that any updates or changes to the reward function maintain alignment with intended goals rather than creating opportunities for gaming. This requires careful management of how reward functions evolve and how systems handle potential changes to their reward functions.

### Questions

- How can we formally verify that incremental updates to a reward function preserve desired invariants and alignment properties while allowing for necessary refinements?

- What mechanisms could enable an AI system to recognize and reject potentially misaligned reward function updates while still accepting legitimate improvements?

- How can we develop robust methods to measure 'drift' between an original reward function and its updated versions to detect subtle misalignment introduced through sequences of small changes?

- What mathematical frameworks could help us define and maintain 'alignment boundaries' - formal constraints that all valid reward function updates must satisfy to be considered aligned?

- How can we design reward function update mechanisms that are robust to potential adversarial attacks while remaining responsive to legitimate correction needs?

- What methods could enable safe experimental testing of reward function updates in restricted domains before deploying them more broadly?

- How can we develop formal methods to decompose reward functions into core aligned components that must be preserved and flexible components that can be safely modified?

- What techniques could help us distinguish between reward function changes that represent genuine improvements in alignment versus those that merely appear beneficial but introduce subtle misalignment?
