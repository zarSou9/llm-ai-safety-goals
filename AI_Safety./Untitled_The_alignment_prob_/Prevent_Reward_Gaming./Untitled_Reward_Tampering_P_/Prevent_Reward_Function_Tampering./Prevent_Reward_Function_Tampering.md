### Description

Ensure AI systems cannot achieve higher rewards by directly modifying their reward function or influencing how it gets updated. This includes preventing both direct manipulation of the reward mechanism and indirect influence over feedback/training processes that modify the reward function.

### Questions

- How can we formally verify that a reward function's implementation is tamper-proof against an AI system that has complete knowledge of its own architecture but limited ability to modify its own code?

- What mathematical properties of reward functions make them more or less susceptible to self-modification, and can we design reward functions that are provably stable against attempts at self-modification?

- How can we detect and measure subtle forms of reward function tampering that occur gradually during the training process, before they manifest as obvious gaming behaviors?

- What role do attention mechanisms play in enabling or preventing reward function tampering, and how can we design attention architectures that maintain performance while restricting access to reward-related components?

- How can we leverage cryptographic techniques to create 'tamper-evident' reward functions that make any modification attempts immediately detectable, while still allowing legitimate updates?

- What are the fundamental trade-offs between a reward function's adaptability to legitimate environmental changes and its resistance to tampering, and how can we optimize this balance?

- How can we design reward functions that maintain their intended behavior even when parts of their implementation are corrupted or modified, similar to error-correcting codes in information theory?

- What novel architectural patterns or training procedures could create natural barriers between an AI system's action selection and its reward machinery, without requiring explicit compartmentalization?
